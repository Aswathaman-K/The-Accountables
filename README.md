# The-Accountables
A Python project to simulate a prototype banking database.


This uses Python's Tkinter Package to provide a simple GUI. MySQL Database connectivity is implemented to store data of the user.
Use the images provided to configure the client side database tables. 
Install the Tkinter package and run the TABS-TK-Final.py program to start using the system.
Alternatively, TABS-Final.py can be run for users who don't have Tkinter or can't install Tkinter.
